						<h1 class="display-3">What are pulsars?</h1>
						<p class="lead">Pulsars are the stellar remains of massive stars. They are formed when the core of a star is compressed during a supernova forming a neutron star. This type of neutron star actually maintains the angular momentum of the original star, however it only a fraction of the size which causes its high rotation speed. Pulsars get their name from the beam of radiation that is emitted along the magnetic axis of the neutron star which acts like a stellar lighthouse due to the neutron star's rotation. </p>

						<p>A pulsar is the collapsed core of a large star which before collapse had a total of between 10 and 29 solar masses. Neutron stars, and pulsars which are a type of neutron star, are the smallest and densest stars known to exist. Though neutron stars typically have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi), they can have masses of about twice that of the Sun. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. <sup id="cite-link-1"><a href="#cite-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

						<p>The eletromagenetic radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (much the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that range from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. <sup id="cite-link-2"><a href="#cite-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

						<p>This event has shown scientists two things. "One is that, as theoreticians had predicted, gravitational waves appear to travel at the speed of light. There's still some imprecision in the measurements that could allow them to travel close, but not quite, to the speed of light, but the new measurements mean that it would have to be very, very close. The second thing is that it nails down neutron star collisions as the source of some gamma-ray bursts" <sup id="cite-link-3"><a href="#cite-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
